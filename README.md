Tech Blog
Description
This is a website that allows users to create posts of their own as well as comment on other's posts as well.

I used class mini project files as a template to work off of.

I added files that allows the website to function and fixed login issue.

Updated the CSS to make the site look better.

Added a cookie timeout function that times out the user when they are idle for too long.

Added an update button for user to update post.
